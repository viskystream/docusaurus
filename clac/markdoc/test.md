{% /note  %}


Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications of changes to specific resources in our system.

## How It Works

When one of the specified events occurs, we will send an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.

### Event Types

Here are some of the event types you can subscribe to:

- `user.created`: Triggered when a new user is created.
- `user.updated`: Triggered when an existing user is updated.
- `user.deleted`: Triggered when a user is deleted.
- `invoice.paid`: Triggered when an invoice is marked as paid.
- `invoice.failed`: Triggered when an invoice payment fails.

### Example Payload

Below is an example of the JSON payload sent to your webhook URL when the `user.created` event is triggered:

```json
{
"id": "evt_1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J",
"type": "user.created",
"data": {
"id": "user_12345",
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"created_at": "2023-06-04T12:34:56Z"
}
}
```
